A simple to use app with a very simple menu as the following
 "(1) to add new task
  (2) to edit a task
  (3) show task list by date or project"
  (4) to mark a task as DONE!"
  (5) to save and quit"
  
  Basically, user chooses the number of the option he/she wants the app to do. Every number will be doing the option assigned.
  If you chose number 1, you will be able to add task, you will be asked for title, project to relate it to and of course a 
  valid due date which format should be similar to "dd-MM-yyyy". The newly added task will always be marked as "Not DONE".
  If you chose number 2, you will be able to edit the task. You will be given a list of tasks with their IDs, the ID of your
  choosing will be used to retreive the task associated with -so make sure you chose the correct ID- Only then you will be 
  asked to change the title, project and due date.
  If you chose number 3, you will be able to see list of tasks as per project title or due date. After pushing number 3 option
  you will get two more options which are, number 1 to sort tasks as per the project title and number 2 to sort tasks as per
  the due date.
  If you chose number 4, you will be able to choose a task by its uniqe ID and mark it as DONE task.
  Last but not least, number 5, which is to save and quit the app. It is very important to press number 5 before exiting the
  app, so you have all your tasks saved in a file for later usage.
